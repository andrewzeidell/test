# Recommended Folder Structure for a Godot Project in VSCode

A typical Godot project has a simple and clear folder structure. Below is a recommended layout to organize your Godot project within VSCode:

```
GodotProject/
├── .vscode/                  # VSCode settings specific to Godot
│   └── settings.json         # Editor settings, extensions, launch configs
├── .import/                  # Auto-generated by Godot (do not edit)
├── .godot/                   # Godot editor metadata (hidden)
├── assets/                   # Game assets (images, sounds, fonts, etc.)
├── scenes/                   # Godot scene files (.tscn, .scn)
├── scripts/                  # GDScript or other scripts (.gd, .cs)
├── addons/                   # Godot plugins or addons
├── project.godot             # Godot project configuration file
├── export_presets.cfg        # Export templates and presets
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Notes:
- Keep `.import` and `.godot` folders under version control only if necessary; usually `.import` is ignored.
- Use `.vscode/settings.json` to configure Godot-specific extensions and debugging.
- Organize assets, scenes, and scripts into separate folders for clarity.
- The `project.godot` file is essential and must be at the root.
- Use `export_presets.cfg` to manage export targets.

This structure keeps your Godot project clean and manageable within VSCode, separate from other projects like Python ML.
